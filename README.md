**Comments** are lines of code that JavaScript will intentionally ignore. 

There are two ways to write comments in JavaScript:

Using // will tell JavaScript to ignore the remainder of the text on the current line. This is an in-line comment:

// This is an in-line comment.
You can make a multi-line comment beginning with /* and ending with */. This is a multi-line comment:

/* This is a
multi-line comment */



JavaScript provides eight different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, bigint, number, and object.

We tell JavaScript to create or declare a **variable** by putting the keyword var in front of it, like so:

var ourName;
creates a variable called ourName. In JavaScript we end statements with semicolons. Variable names can be made up of numbers, letters, and $ or _, but may not contain spaces or start with a number.

When JavaScript variables are declared, they have an **initial value of undefined**. If you do a mathematical operation on an undefined variable your result will be **NaN which means "Not a Number"**. If you concatenate a string with an undefined variable, you will get a literal string of undefined.
